# University Student Portal  
This is my mock implementation of a Student Lifecycle Management (SLCM) portal of a university student using Django web framework.  
Among many ideas for a personal Django project, I chose this one because this is something I have used first hand in my own university and I felt an urge to make a better/cleaner version of it.  
In fact, the UI design and data model are all inspired from my university's SLCM.  
  
## How to use?  
This application would not work since it is configured for deployment to production.  
But, I have added an `.env` file contrary to convention so that the application can be deployed locally.  

## Login Credentials  
Use the following superuser credentials to open the application:  
  username : prash  
  password : testpass123
